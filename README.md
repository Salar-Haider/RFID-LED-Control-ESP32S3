# ESP32-S3-RC522-RFID-LED-Control
ESP32-S3 RC522 RFID LED Control is a simple educational project that reads RFID cards using the MFRC522 module and controls an LED based on the scanned card. Specific cards can turn the LED on or off, with all activity displayed on the Serial Monitor, demonstrating SPI communication, GPIO control, and RFID interfacing with the ESP32-S3 N16R8.
